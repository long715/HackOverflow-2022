# HackOverflow-2022
repository dedicated to WDCC x SESA Hackathon!

This web app aims to gamify reading/studying by tracking your reading progress to earn points that you can use to buy cosmetics for your personal motivational owl! It also includes supporting study features such as a To-Do List and Pomodoro Clock.

The demo includes the mentioned study features, a PDF uploader and viewer so you can read your books/study materials and a progress tracker. Future updates could include the point system and the owl cosmetics. 

Thank you for visiting our repository and have fun reading!
